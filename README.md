🐍 Python Fundamentals – Complete Basics Repository
📌 Overview

This repository contains my structured learning journey through Python fundamentals, covering core programming concepts required for data analysis, automation, and software development.

The goal of this repository is to build a strong foundation in Python by understanding:

Data types

Operators

Conditional statements

Loops

Core data structures

Type conversions

Logical reasoning in code

Every concept is clearly explained in comments within the code for better understanding and revision.

🧠 Topics Covered
1️⃣ Data Types

File: datatypes.py

Numeric types (int, float, complex)

Boolean values

Strings

Lists (mutable sequences)

Tuples (immutable sequences)

Sets (unique unordered collections)

Dictionaries (key-value pairs)

Mutable vs Immutable objects

Implicit & Explicit type conversion

Key Concepts Demonstrated:

Indexing & slicing

Nested lists

Set operations (union, intersection, symmetric difference)

Dictionary methods (keys(), values(), items())

Handling built-in function shadowing

Data type casting

2️⃣ Operators in Python

File: operators.py

Covered all major operator categories:

Arithmetic Operators (+, -, *, /, //, %, **)

Comparison Operators (==, !=, >, <)

Logical Operators (and, or, not)

Assignment Operators (+=, etc.)

Identity Operators (is)

Membership Operators (in, not in)

Bitwise Operators (concept overview)

Additional concepts:

PEMDAS execution order

Using math module functions

Understanding memory vs value comparison

3️⃣ Conditional Statements

File: statements.py

if

elif

else

Nested conditionals

Indentation-based code blocks (Python-specific behavior)

Mini logic implementations:

Height classification

Sales categorization

Membership checks

Multi-level grading system

Concept Emphasis:

Control flow logic

Decision making

4️⃣ Loops & Iteration

File: for_loops.py

Basic for loops

Iterating over:

Lists

Dictionaries

Nested conditions inside loops

Using enumerate()

Manual counters

Data classification using loops
