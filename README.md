# 🐍 Python Fundamentals – Complete Basics Repository
## 📌 Overview

This repository contains my structured learning journey through Python fundamentals, covering core programming concepts required for data analysis, automation, and software development.

The goal of this repository is to build a strong foundation in Python by understanding:

Data types

Operators

Conditional statements

Loops

Core data structures

Type conversions

Logical reasoning in code

Every concept is clearly explained in comments within the code for better understanding and revision.

## 🧠 Topics Covered
### 1️⃣ Data Types

File: datatypes.py

Numeric types (int, float, complex)

Boolean values

Strings

Lists (mutable sequences)

Tuples (immutable sequences)

Sets (unique unordered collections)

Dictionaries (key-value pairs)

Mutable vs Immutable objects

Implicit & Explicit type conversion

Key Concepts Demonstrated:

Indexing & slicing

Nested lists

Set operations (union, intersection, symmetric difference)

Dictionary methods (keys(), values(), items())

Handling built-in function shadowing

Data type casting

### 2️⃣ Operators in Python

File: operators.py

Covered all major operator categories:

Arithmetic Operators (+, -, *, /, //, %, **)

Comparison Operators (==, !=, >, <)

Logical Operators (and, or, not)

Assignment Operators (+=, etc.)

Identity Operators (is)

Membership Operators (in, not in)

Bitwise Operators (concept overview)

Additional concepts:

PEMDAS execution order

Using math module functions

Understanding memory vs value comparison

### 3️⃣ Conditional Statements

File: statements.py

if

elif

else

Nested conditionals

Indentation-based code blocks (Python-specific behavior)

Mini logic implementations:

Height classification

Sales categorization

Membership checks

Multi-level grading system

Concept Emphasis:

Control flow logic

Decision making

Clean conditional structuring

### 4️⃣ Loops & Iteration

File: for_loops.py

Basic for loops

Iterating over:

Lists

Dictionaries

Nested conditions inside loops

Using enumerate()

Manual counters

Data classification using loops

Mini Practice Scenarios:

Categorizing sales amounts

Printing formatted outputs

Power calculations

Dictionary traversal

### 🔎 Key Programming Concepts Strengthened

Problem-solving using logic

Clean code structuring

Data structure manipulation

Python memory understanding

Iteration techniques

Real-world scenario simulation


### 5️⃣ Control Statements

break

continue

pass

else with loops

### 6️⃣ List Comprehension

Filtering conditions

Cleaner & more efficient iteration

Replacing traditional loop logic with concise expressions

### 🛠 Technologies Used

Python 3

Built-in functions

math module

### 🧠 Key Skills Developed

Strong understanding of Python core syntax

Logical thinking & control flow design

Working with different data structures

Writing clean iteration logic

Understanding memory references (is)

Data filtering & transformation fundamentals



### 🚀 Why This Matters

These fundamentals form the backbone for:

📊 Data Analysis (Pandas, NumPy)

📈 Data Visualization

🤖 Automation Scripts

🧮 Algorithmic Problem Solving

🗄️ Backend & Data Engineering workflows

Mastering these basics ensures writing efficient, readable, and scalable Python code.
